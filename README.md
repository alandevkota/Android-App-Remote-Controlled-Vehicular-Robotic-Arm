# Android-App-Remote-Controlled-Vehicular-Robotic-Arm
Remote controlled system (robot) from self developed android app that constantly performs the task of picking an object and moving it to the desired location (both automatic and manual).


In this project, a vehicular robotic arm is made and controlled by an Android mobile app. The development of this model is through ESP32 along with a mobile phone for controlling the robot. This prototype may be expected to overcome the problems of picking hazardous objects or non-hazardous objects that are far away from the user and where displacement of very heavy objects is needed from one place to another as automation is required in many industries.
